This code can help you decide which probe to use for certain EPR (electron
paramagnetic resonance) oximetry experiments

- Instructions -----------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to use this code is probably to simply copy the example.m file
and modify it for your needs. It is heavily commented. You can see the figures
produced by this script at https://github.com/jalan/probe_selection/wiki

- Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is based on our EPR experiment design papers, [1] and [2]; the same
assumptions that we rely on there apply here.

rank_probes assumes we are doing a single-scan acquisition, since this is the
current common practice.

The scores returned by rank_probes, and the values on the vertical axes of the
optional plots, are arbitrary in some sense: they depend on the values of
sigma_N and M that you supply.
 - If you DO know these values, great: the scores and plots will be realistic.
 - If you DON'T know these values, that's fine too: just provide some default
   values like sigma_N=1e18 and M=512; then the scores and the plots may not
   be realistic, but the probes will still be ranked correctly.

Please report any issues at https://github.com/jalan/probe_selection/issues, or
contact me directly if you prefer.
