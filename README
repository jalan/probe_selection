This code can help you decide which probe to use for certain EPR (electron
paramagnetic resonance) oximetry experiments

- Instructions -----------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to use this code is probably to simply copy the example.m file
and modify it for your needs

- Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is based on our EPR experiment design papers, [1] and [2]; the same
assumptions that we rely on there apply here.

rank_probes assumes we are doing a single-scan acquisition, since this is the
current common practice.

TODO: note about scores and/or vertical axes on the optional plots

to produce the figures in [2] are available
